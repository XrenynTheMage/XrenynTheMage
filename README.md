- 👋 Hi, I’m @XrenynTheMage
- 👀 I’m interested in all things art, especially in composing and producing music that grabs you by the heart, and - of course - in software development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to build a Hololens 2 App with Unity and MRTK, at the same time I'm getting prepared to write an epic fantasy short film, 
which will undoubtibly be the biggest creative project I've worked on.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on notetaking software, as I depend on so many of em
- 📫 You can drop me an email at thomas[dot]fritz[at]student[dot]hs-anhalt.de if you want
